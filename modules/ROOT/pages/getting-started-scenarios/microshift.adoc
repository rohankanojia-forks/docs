Testing
Once you've downloaded and installed {prod} on your machine, you're ready to use {prod} by creating a cluster. https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/edge-computing/microshift[{ushift}]
is not the default cluster type that would be created when no explicit configuration is provided.

In order to instruct {prod} to create a https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/edge-computing/microshift[{ushift}] cluster, we need to update {prod} configuration:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set preset microshift
----

**Set up environment for your cluster**

Before starting cluster, you need to prepare your machine for creating a Virtual Machine. {ushift} cluster would be started
inside that Virtual Machine. In order to do that use xref:using.adoc#setting-up[`{bin} setup`] command.

Open a terminal with a user account with administrator access (but not logged in as root user) and run:
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} setup
----

**Start your cluster**

Once you've set up environment for your {ushift} cluster, you can go ahead and start it.

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start
----

**Deploy a sample application to your {ushift} cluster**

Create a sample deployment and expose it on port 8080:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ oc create deployment hello-crc --image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/httpd-24
$ oc expose deployment hello-crc --type=NodePort --port=8080
$ oc expose svc/hello-crc
----

Wait for application pod to become ready and access application via route:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ oc get routes
$ curl http://hello-crc-default.apps.crc.testing
----
