[id='about-presets']
== About presets

[role="_abstract"]
{prod} presets represent a managed container runtime, and the lower bounds of system resources required by the instance to run it.
Here are various supported presets for {prod} along with their minimum system requirements:

[cols="5,5,5,5,5", options="header"]
|===
| Preset Name | Description | CPUs | RAM | Disk space

| `openshift`
| {ocp}
| 4
| 10.5 GB
| 35 GB

| `okd`
| {okd}
| 4
| 10.5 GB
| 35 GB

| `microshift`
| {ushift}
| 2
| 4 GB
| 35 GB
|===

On {msw} and {mac}, the {prod} guided installer prompts you for your desired preset.
On Linux, the {ocp} preset is selected by default.

TIP: You can change this selection using the [command]`{bin} config` command before running the [command]`{bin} setup` command.

IMPORTANT: Only one preset can be active at a time.

Let's take a look into each of these presets in detail:

[id='openshift-preset']
=== {openshift}

`openshift` preset creates a minimal, single-node cluster for https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform]. This cluster is very similar to
real https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform] set up in cloud environments like AWS, GCP, Azure etc. It's only meant to be used
for development and testing purposes.

This preset is the default preset used by {prod} if not explicit preset is configured.

If you want to configure this preset, you can do it like this:
[source,shell]
----
$ crc delete # Remove previous cluster (if present)
$ crc config set preset openshift # Configure to use openshift preset
$ crc setup # Initialize environment for cluster
$ crc start # Start the cluster
----

[id='okd-preset']
=== {okd}

{okd} preset creates a minimal, single-node cluster for https://okd.io/docs/project/about[OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution]. It
is an upstream, community-driven project that provides the core components needed to run Kubernetes. It has similar requirements
to the OpenShift Container Platform preset.

If you want to configure this preset, you can do it like this:
[source,shell]
----
$ crc delete # Remove previous cluster (if present)
$ crc config set preset okd # Configure to use okd preset
$ crc setup # Initialize environment for cluster
$ crc start # Start the cluster
----

[id='microshift-preset']
=== {ushift}

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/edge-computing/microshift[{ushift}] is a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration
solution designed by https://www.redhat.com/en[Red Hat]. It's essentially a smaller, more resource-efficient version of
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift], optimized for edge computing.

NOTE: This preset shouldn't be confused with {openshift} preset. It is tailored for environments with limited resources. {openshift} on
the other hand, is a full-featured platform designed for larger-scale deployments and comprehensive management. For more details, please
refer to https://github.com/openshift/microshift#user-documentation[{ushift} documentation].

If you want to configure this preset, you can do it like this:
[source,shell]
----
$ crc delete # Remove previous cluster (if present)
$ crc config set preset microshift # Configure to use microshift preset
$ crc setup # Initialize environment for cluster
$ crc start # Start the cluster
----

[id='about-pullsecrets']
== About Pull Secrets
When using the {openshift} or {ushift} preset, {prod} requires pull secret:

. To pull the virtual machine bundle.
. To pull {ocp} container images from the Red Hat registry.

When running [command]`{bin} start` the first time, when the pull secret has not been provisioned, {prod} prompts to provide a pull secret.

=== Providing pull secret to {prod}

.Prerequisites
. Download pull secret from the Pull Secret section of the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local[{prod} page on the {rh} Hybrid Cloud Console] to _<pull_secret_file>_ location.

.Procedure
* Enter pull secret value when {prod} prompts to provide pull secret.
{prod} stores the pull secret in the Operating System's credential manager so that {prod} doesn't ask for pull secret again in case existing cluster is deleted and a new one is created.
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {bin} start
...
? Please enter the pull secret
----
+
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, specify pull secret file location by using the `--pull-secret-file` CLI argument.
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {bin} start --pull-secret-file=_<pull_secret_file>_
----
====
+
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, specify pull secret file location by setting the `pull-secret-file` configuration.
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {bin} config set pull-secret-file _<pull_secret_file>_
$ {bin} start
----
====

Please note that this pull secret would only be removed from the Operating System's credential manager when user runs [command]`{bin} cleanup` command.

It's also possible to remove pull secret from the Operating System's credential manager configuration manually. 

[id='clearning-credential-manager-pullsecret']
=== Clearing Pull Secret from Credential Manager
Steps to clear entries from the Credential Manager on different operating systems.

==== Windows

. Open the Control Panel.
. Go to `User Accounts` > `Credential Manager`.
