== Starting monitoring

{prod} disables cluster monitoring by default to ensure that {prod} can run on a typical notebook.
Monitoring is responsible for listing your cluster in the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].
Follow this procedure to enable monitoring for your cluster.

.Prerequisites
* You must assign additional memory to the {prod} instance.
At least 14 GiB of memory, a value of `14336`, is recommended for core functionality.
Increased workloads will require more memory.
For more information, see xref:configuring.adoc#configuring-the-instance[Configuring the instance].

.Procedure
. Set the `enable-cluster-monitoring` configurable property to `true`:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set enable-cluster-monitoring true
----

. Start the instance:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Cluster monitoring cannot be disabled.
To remove monitoring, set the `enable-cluster-monitoring` configurable property to `false` and delete the existing {prod} instance.

== Enabling override Operators

To verify {prod} can run on a typical notebook, some resource-heavy services get disabled by default.
These services can be enabled by manually removing the desired Operator from the Operator override list.

.Prerequisites
* A running {prod} virtual machine and a working [command]`oc` command.
For more information, see xref:using.adoc#accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-the-openshift-cli[Accessing the OpenShift cluster with `oc`].
* You must log in through [command]`oc` as the `kubeadmin` user.

.Procedure
. List unmanaged Operators and note the numeric index for the desired Operator:

** On Linux or {mac}:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -ojsonpath='{range .spec.overrides[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | nl -v -2
----

** On {msw} using PowerShell:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
PS> oc get clusterversion version -ojsonpath='{range .spec.overrides[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | % {$nl++;"`t$($nl-3) `t $_"};$nl=0
----

. Start the desired Operator using the identified numeric index:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch clusterversion/version --type='json' -p '[{"op":"remove", "path":"/spec/overrides/_<unmanaged-operator-index>_"}]'
clusterversion.config.openshift.io/version patched
----
