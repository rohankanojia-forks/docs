[id='about-configuration']
== About {prod} configuration

Use the [command]`{bin} config` command to configure both the [command]`{bin}` executable and the {prod} instance.
The [command]`{bin} config` command requires a subcommand to act on the configuration.
The available subcommands are `get`, `set,` `unset`, and `view`.
The `get`, `set`, and `unset` subcommands operate on named configurable properties.
Run the [command]`{bin} config --help` command to list the available properties.

You can also use the [command]`{bin} config` command to configure the behavior of the startup checks for the [command]`{bin} start` and [command]`{bin} setup` commands.
By default, startup checks report an error and stop execution when their conditions are not met.
Set the value of a property starting with `skip-check` to `true` to skip the check.

[id='viewing-configuration']
== Viewing {prod} configuration

The {prod} executable provides commands to view configurable properties and the current {prod} configuration.

.Procedure
. To view the complete current configuration diverting from default values:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config view
----

. To list the available configurable properties:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config --help
----

. To view the values for a configurable property:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config get _<property>_
----

[id='configuring-usage-data-collection']
== Configuring usage data collection

{prod} prompts you before use for link:{telemetry-notice-url}[optional, anonymous usage data collection to assist with development].
No personally identifiable information is collected.

[id='consenting-usage-data-collection']
=== Consenting usage data collection

You can grant consent for usage data collection at any time.

.Procedure
. Configure {prod} to grant consent for usage data collection.
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set consent-telemetry yes
----
. Restart your {prod} instance to enable the change.
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} stop
$ {bin} start
----

[id='revoking-usage-data-collection']
=== Revoking usage data collection

You can revoke consent for usage data collection at any time.

.Procedure
. Configure {prod} to revoke consent for usage data collection.
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set consent-telemetry no
----
. Restart your {prod} instance to enable the change.
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} stop
$ {bin} start
----

.Additional resources
* link:{telemetry-notice-url}[{rh} Telemetry data collection notice].

[id='changing-the-selected-preset']
== Changing the selected preset

You can change the container runtime used for the {prod} instance by selecting the desired preset before creating the instance.

You cannot change the preset of an existing {prod} instance.

.Procedure
. Change the selected preset from the command line:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set preset __<name>__
----
+
Valid preset names are:
+
.Preset names
[%header,format=csv,cols="1,2"]
|===
Name, Preset
`openshift`, {ocp}
`okd`, {okd}
`microshift`, {ushift}
|===

. Save any desired information stored in your existing instance.

. Delete the existing {prod} instance.
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} delete
----

. Start the new {prod} instance:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start
----

[id='configuring-the-instance']
== Configuring the instance

Use the `cpus` and `memory` properties to configure the default number of vCPUs and amount of memory available to the {prod} instance, respectively.

Alternatively, the number of vCPUs and amount of memory can be assigned using the `--cpus` and `--memory` flags to the `{bin} start` command, respectively.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot change the configuration of a running {prod} instance.
To enable configuration changes, you must stop the running instance and start it again.
====

.Procedure
. To configure the number of vCPUs available to the instance:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set cpus __<number>__
----
+
The default value for the `cpus` property is `4`.
The number of vCPUs to assign must be greater than or equal to the default.

. To start the instance with the desired number of vCPUs:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start --cpus __<number>__
----

. To configure the memory available to the instance:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set memory __<number-in-mib>__
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Values for available memory are set in mebibytes (MiB).
One gibibyte (GiB) of memory is equal to 1024 MiB.
====
+
The default value for the `memory` property is `10752`.
The amount of memory to assign must be greater than or equal to the default.

. To start the instance with the desired amount of memory:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start --memory __<number-in-mib>__
----
