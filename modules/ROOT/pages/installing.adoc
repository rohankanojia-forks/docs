[id='minimum-system-requirements']
== Minimum system requirements

[role="_abstract"]
{prod} has the following minimum hardware and operating system requirements.

=== Hardware requirements

{prod} is supported on these architectures:

.Preset and architecture compatibility
[%header,format=csv,cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
Preset, AMD64, Intel 64, Apple silicon
{ocp}, yes, yes,  yes
{okd}, yes, yes, no
{ushift}, yes, yes, yes
|===

{prod} does not support nested virtualization.

Depending on the desired container runtime, {prod} requires the following system resources:

==== For {ocp}

* 4 physical CPU cores
* 10.5 GB of free memory
* 35 GB of storage space

==== For {ushift}

* 2 physical CPU cores
* 4 GB of free memory
* 35 GB of storage space

[NOTE]
====
The {ocp} and {ushift} presets require these minimum resources to run in the {prod} instance.
Some workloads might require more resources.
To assign more resources to the {prod} instance, see xref:configuring.adoc[Configuring the instance].
====

=== Operating system requirements

{prod} requires the following minimum version of a supported operating system:

{msw}::

* Fully updated {msw} 10 or {msw} 11.
* {prod} does not work on earlier {msw} versions.
* {prod} does not work on {msw} Home Edition.

{mac}::

* {mac} 13 Ventura or later.
* {prod} does not work on earlier {mac} versions.

Linux::

{rhel}:::
* Latest two minor releases.
* The host running {prod} is link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273[registered with the Red Hat Customer Portal].
* `libvirt` and `NetworkManager` packages are installed.
+
----
sudo dnf install libvirt NetworkManager
----

{centos}:::
* Latest two 8 and 9 minor releases.
* `libvirt` and `NetworkManager` packages are installed.
+
----
sudo dnf install libvirt NetworkManager
----

{fed}:::
* Latest two stable releases.
* `libvirt` and `NetworkManager` packages are installed.
+
----
sudo dnf install libvirt NetworkManager
----

{ubuntu} 18.04 LTS or later and {debian} 10 or later:::
* Not supported.
* Might require manual set up of the host machine.
* `libvirt` and `network-manager` packages are installed.
+
----
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon libvirt-daemon-system network-manager

[id='installing']
== Installing {prod}

{prod} is available as a portable executable for {rhel}.
On {msw} and {mac}, {prod} is available using a guided installer.

.Prerequisites
* Your host machine meets the xref:minimum-system-requirements[minimum system requirements].

.Procedure
. Follow the instruction in the link:{crc-download-url}[Red Hat OpenShift Local download page].
Red Hat OpenShift Local is the distribution of the [command]`{bin}` CLI by Red Hat that includes a fully functional {ocp} single node bundle.

. On {msw}, extract the contents of the archive.

. On {mac} or {msw}, run the guided installer and follow the instructions.
+
[NOTE]
====
On {msw}, you must install {prod} to your local [filename]*_C:\_* drive.
You cannot run {prod} from a network drive.
====
+
On {rhel}, assuming the archive is in the [filename]*_~/Downloads_* directory, follow these steps:
+
.. Extract the contents of the archive:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ tar xvf crc-linux-amd64.tar.xz
----
+
.. Create the [filename]*_~/bin_* directory if it does not exist and copy the [command]`{bin}` executable to it:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/bin
$ cp ~/Downloads/crc-linux-*-amd64/{bin} ~/bin
----
+
.. Add the [filename]*_~/bin_* directory to your `$PATH`:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
----

[id='upgrading']
== Upgrading {prod}

Newer versions of the {prod} executable require manual set up to prevent potential incompatibilities with earlier versions.

.Procedure
. link:{crc-download-url}[Download the latest {prod} release].

. Save any desired information stored in your existing instance.

. Delete the existing {prod} instance.
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} delete
----

. Replace the earlier [command]`{bin}` executable with the executable of the latest release.
Verify that the new [command]`{bin}` executable is in use by checking its version:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} version
----

. Set up the new {prod} release:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} setup
----

. Start the new {prod} instance:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start
----
